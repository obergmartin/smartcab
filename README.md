# Train a Smartcab How to Drive

Reinforcement Learning Project

## Install

This project requires Python 2.7 with the pygame library installed:

https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

## Code

The file `smartcab/agent.py` implements the `LearningAgent` which learns how to navigate given the restrictions imposed by `smartcab/environment.py`. Only `smartcab\agent.py` should be modified to chage the agent's behavior.

## Run

Make sure you are in the top-level project directory `smartcab/` (that contains this README). Then run:

```python smartcab/agent.py```

OR:

```python -m smartcab.agent```
